## How to contribute to JavaEE generator for jHipster

#### **Did you find a bug?**
* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/hostops/generator-jhipster-javaee/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/hostops/generator-jhipster-javaee/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

#### **Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?**

Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial to the stability, functionality, or testability of Rails will generally not be accepted (read more about [our rationales behind this decision](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/13771#issuecomment-32746700)).

#### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

* Open issue on github and label "enhancement"

#### **Do you have questions about the source code?**
